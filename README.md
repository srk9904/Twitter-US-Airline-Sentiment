# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Sentiment Analysis using Ensemble Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based sentiment analysis project focused on classifying sentiments from airline-related tweets. It explores traditional ML models, modern ensemble methods, and embeddings like TF-IDF and FastText. The final goal is to build a robust, accurate sentiment classifier tailored for real-world short-form text data.
